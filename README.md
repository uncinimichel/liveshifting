Be able to see who has triggered your Raspberry Pi's PIR motion sensors. 

# To Discuss

* Pictures Or Videos?

Think about in terms of how much space needed locally or on the cloud.
Plus what it is going to be better if I am going to use a Object Detections model?
   
* Local Storage  
* Pictures size and quality 
* Configurations

* Plug and play

I would like to have a solutions where I have hardware. Plug somewhere start working

* How to send 

* Data science model

Local or on the Cloud?   

* Notifications

* live feed

* PIR 

Sensitivity Potentiometer Vs time potentiometer



* First Delivery

If PIR detect something I would like to see the camera starting taking pictures (Or video). This recording should be accessible on AWS S3.
